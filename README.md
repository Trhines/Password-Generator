# Password-Generator

This project was built to test my ability to think creatively when writing logic, and to learn how to use different kinds of pop ups. Prompts seemed to work the best for this project.  

This Website will randomly generate a password based on the answers givin by the user, and then passwords may be generated repeatedly.

The first click on the generate button will start the question prompts. The user must enter a desired password length and what kind of characters should be included in the password. If an incorrect input is givin the question will be asked again until a correct answer is givin, answers are not case sensitive. If no characters are selected to be in the password, the prompts asking for characters will start over and loop until at least one set of characters is allowed. Once a password is generated the generate button can be used again to generate more passwords with the same criteria. To change length or characters in the password, the page must be refreshed.
